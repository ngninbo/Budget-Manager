<h2>Packing bakeries</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>You are working in a Pie company. The business is going well and bakeries are selling abroad. Sometimes due to customs rules and trade regulations, it is necessary to package bakeries in a box with a more basic name like Bakery or Food. The full class hierarchy follows: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">class Food {}

class Bakery extends Food {}

class Cake extends Bakery {}

class Pie extends Bakery {}

class Tart extends Bakery {}

interface Box&lt;T&gt; {
    public void put(T item);
    public T get();
}</code></pre> 
  <p>There is a <code class="language-java">Packer</code> class available, but it is designed with business rule violations and lacks implementation. Correct the Packer code to ensure that:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Any kind of Bakery could be repacked in a Box with a more basic type (e.g. from a box with Pie to a box with Food)</li> 
   <li>Basic stuff like food can't be repacked into narrowly typed Boxes (e.g. with Cakes)</li> 
   <li>Arbitrary stuff like Strings or Objects can't be repacked without compile-time errors or warnings</li> 
   <li>Repacking actually happens</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If this task takes too much time, try to skip it.</p>
